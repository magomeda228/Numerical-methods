2nd lab calculates definite integrals numerically using three methods:
 Rectangle Method
 Trapezoidal Method
 Simpson's Method
It also compares their results to the true value of the integral and visualizes the convergence and error behavior as the number of subintervals increases.

What the Code Does?:
1) Target Function and True Integral:
 The function to integrate is $$f(x)=x^3$$
 The analytical value of the integral is calculated using the formula for the integral of $$f(x)=x^3$$, $$F(x)=x^4/4$$, to provide a true value for comprasion.
2) Integration Methods:
 Rectangle Method: Approximates the area using rectangles, summing their areas across ùëõ subintervals.
 Trapezoidal Method: Approximates the area using trapezoids formed between the function's values at adjacent points.
 Simpson's Method: Approximates the area using parabolic arcs through groups of three adjacent points (requires an even number of subintervals).
3) Computing Results:
 The number of subintervals (ùëõ) is varied from a minimum value (min_n) in steps of step_n, for a total of num_steps steps.
 For each value of ùëõ, the three methods compute the integral approximation and calculate the absolute error compared to the true integral value.
4) Visualization:
 Integral Convergence: Plots the computed integral values for all methods against the number of subintervals n, with the true value as a reference.
 Error Analysis: Plots the absolute error of each method against n, along with theoretical error estimates using Runge's rule for trapezoidal and Simpson‚Äôs methods.
5) Runge's Error Rule:
 For trapezoidal: Error $$~C/n^2$$, where C depends on the range and the function's second derivative.
 For Simpson's: Error $$~C/n^4$$, where C depends on the range and the fourth derivative.
6) Output Results:
 Prints the computed integral values and their absolute errors for all methods.

How to Use:
1) Input Parameters:
 Left and right boundaries of integration (ùê¥,ùêµ).
 Minimum number of subintervals (n_min).
 Step size for increasing n.
 Number of steps to compute.

2)Visual Interpretation:
 The integral convergence plot shows how quickly each method approaches the true integral value as n increases.
 The error plot highlights the rate of convergence and error magnitude for each method, allowing comparison of their accuracy and efficiency.

Output Highlights:
 Integral Values: Lists the computed integral values for each method.
 Errors: Provides the true absolute error for each method.
 Plots: Visualizes the accuracy of each method and how errors decrease as n increases.
