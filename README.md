Lab 1: Numerical Integration Methods
 This lab explores numerical methods for approximating definite integrals: the rectangle, trapezoidal, and Simpson's methods. It calculates the integral of $$f(x)=x^3$$ 
 over a user-defined range and visualizes convergence and error analysis for each method using matplotlib.

Lab 2: Error Analysis
 This lab focuses on analyzing the true and estimated errors for numerical integration methods. It compares the errors of the trapezoidal and Simpson's methods with theoretical predictions, demonstrating how precision improves with increased subintervals.

Lab 3: Calculation of a definite integral
 The method is used to iteratively solve the system of equations 𝐴*𝑋=𝐵. Each iteration updates the solution vector 𝑋 by solving for each unknown sequentially, using the values from the previous iteration for other unknowns. The algorithm stops when the solution 
 converges or the maximum iteration count is reached.
 
Lab 4: Error Analysis:

Calculates errors using the Runge method for different time steps.
Visualizes error data for 9 numerical methods on logarithmic scales.
Euler Method for ODE (Other Inputs):

Solves 𝑑𝑇/𝑑𝑡 = −0.0059𝑇 using the explicit Euler method.
Compares the numerical solution with the analytical solution 
𝑇(𝑡) = 𝑇0𝑒^(−𝑘𝑡) via plots.
